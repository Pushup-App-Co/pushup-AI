## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. How do I get the best tracking results?**
*   Place your phone on the floor or against a wall about 4.5 feet (1.4 meters) away.
*   Ensure your full body is visible in the frame (side profile is best).
*   Wear contrasting clothes if possible.

**2. Why isn't it counting my reps?**
*   The AI is strict! Make sure you go all the way down (elbows at 90 degrees) and all the way up (arms straight).
*   Listen for the audio cues or looking for the text feedback on screen.

**3. Where is my video saved?**
*   Videos are only saved to your Photo Library if you tap the "Share" button after a workout.

**4. How do I delete my data?**
*   Delete the app from your iPhone. All data is stored locally and will be removed instantly.
