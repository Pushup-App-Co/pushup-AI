## Overview
Pushup AI ("the App") is a fitness app that uses your device camera and on-device processing to count reps and assess form. We prioritize privacy and limit data collection to what is needed to deliver the features you use.

## Information We Process

### Camera and On-Device Processing
- The App uses the camera and Apple's Vision framework to detect pose and count repetitions.
- Video frames are processed on your device in memory and are not sent to our servers.
- Video is not stored unless you explicitly generate and save a share video.

### Workout and App Data (Local)
- Workout sessions, counts, and stats are stored locally on your device.
- This data is used to display history, progress, and summaries.

### Health Data (HealthKit, Optional)
- If you opt in, the App reads and writes workout data to Apple Health (HealthKit).
- Health data stays within the Apple Health ecosystem and your device or iCloud backup.

### Social Features (CloudKit, Optional)
- Friend challenges and shared challenge data are stored in your iCloud account using CloudKit.
- Challenge records may include your display name, session stats, and timestamps.
- Sharing a challenge link makes that challenge accessible to people you share it with.

### Notifications
- If enabled, we use Apple Push Notification service (APNs) to deliver challenge updates.
- APNs tokens are used to route notifications to your device.

### Crash and Diagnostic Data
- We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash reports and diagnostic data (such as device model, OS version, and stack traces) to improve stability.
- We also collect MetricKit diagnostics locally on-device for optional user sharing.

### In-App Purchases and Subscriptions
- We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions and in-app purchases.
- RevenueCat collects purchase history, user IDs, device IDs, and product interaction data.
- This data is used to validate purchases, prevent fraud, restore subscriptions, and analyze conversion metrics.
- RevenueCat's privacy policy: https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy

### Photos and Media (Optional)
- If you create a share video, it is stored locally and may be saved to your photo library if you choose.

## How We Use Information
- Provide core tracking and coaching features.
- Display progress, history, and summaries.
- Enable optional social challenges and notifications.
- Diagnose crashes and improve reliability.

## Data Sharing
We do not sell your data. We share data only with:
- Apple services you choose to use (HealthKit, Game Center, CloudKit, APNs).
- RevenueCat for in-app purchase management.
- Google Firebase Crashlytics for crash diagnostics.

## Data Retention
- Local workout data remains on your device until you delete the App or remove data.
- CloudKit challenge data is stored in your iCloud account and managed by Apple.
- Crash and diagnostic data is retained by Firebase or on-device per their retention policies.

## Your Choices
- You can enable or disable HealthKit in iOS Settings.
- You can enable or disable notifications in iOS Settings.
- You can control iCloud/CloudKit access in iOS Settings.
- You can delete the App to remove locally stored data.

## Changes
We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available in the App or on our website.
