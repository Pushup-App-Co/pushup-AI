# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 6, 2026

## Overview
Pushup AI ("the App") is a fitness app that uses your device camera and on-device processing to count reps and assess form. We prioritize privacy and limit data collection to what is needed to deliver the features you use.

## Information We Process

### Camera and On-Device Processing
- The App uses the camera and Apple's Vision framework to detect pose and count repetitions.
- Video frames are processed on your device in memory and are not sent to our servers.
- Video is not stored unless you explicitly generate and save a share video.

### Workout and App Data (Local)
- Workout sessions, counts, and stats are stored locally on your device.
- This data is used to display history, progress, and summaries.

### Health Data (HealthKit, Optional)
- If you opt in, the App reads and writes workout data to Apple Health (HealthKit).
- We do not store Health data on our servers or in iCloud. Health data is managed by Apple Health. Any iCloud storage is controlled by Apple's Health ecosystem and the user's device backup settings.

### Social Features (CloudKit, Optional)
- Friend challenges and shared challenge data are stored in your iCloud account using CloudKit.
- Challenge records may include your display name, session stats, and timestamps.
- Sharing a challenge link makes that challenge accessible to people you share it with.

### Game Center (Optional)
- If you participate in leaderboards, your Game Center nickname and scores may be visible to other players through Apple Game Center.

### Notifications
- If enabled, we use Apple Push Notification service (APNs) to deliver challenge updates.
- APNs tokens are used to route notifications to your device.
- We also use local notifications for reminders and challenge updates that do not require network delivery.

### Crash and Diagnostic Data
- We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash reports and diagnostic data (such as device model, OS version, and stack traces) to improve stability.
- We also collect MetricKit diagnostics locally on-device for optional user sharing.

### In-App Purchases and Subscriptions
- We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions and in-app purchases.
- RevenueCat collects purchase history, app user IDs, device identifiers, and product interaction data to validate purchases and restore subscriptions.
- RevenueCat's privacy policy: https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy

### Photos and Media (Optional)
- If you create a share video, it is stored locally and may be saved to your photo library if you choose.

## How We Use Information
- Provide core tracking and coaching features.
- Display progress, history, and summaries.
- Enable optional social challenges and notifications.
- Diagnose crashes and improve reliability.
- Validate in-app purchases and subscriptions.

## Data Sharing
We do not sell your data. We share data only with:
- Apple services you choose to use (HealthKit, Game Center, CloudKit, APNs).
- RevenueCat for in-app purchase management.
- Google Firebase Crashlytics for crash diagnostics.

## Data Retention
- Local workout data remains on your device until you delete the App or remove data.
- CloudKit challenge data is stored in your iCloud account and managed by Apple. Challenges may be removed when deleted by you or after they expire.
- Crash and diagnostic data is retained by Firebase or on-device per their retention policies.

## Your Choices and Deletion Requests
- You can enable or disable HealthKit, notifications, and iCloud/CloudKit access in iOS Settings.
- You can delete challenges in the app to remove them from CloudKit.
- You can delete the App to remove locally stored data.
- For deletion requests related to CloudKit challenges, RevenueCat subscription data, or Crashlytics data, contact us at apps@lirisconsulting.com.

## Changes
We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available in the App or on our website.
