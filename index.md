# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 14, 2026

## 1. Data Collection & Local Processing
Pushup AI ("The App") prioritizes your privacy. We differ from other apps in that **we do not transmit your video feeds to any cloud server.**
*   **Camera Usage:** The App uses your device's camera and Apple's Vision Framework solely to detect body pose and count repetitions in real-time.
*   **No Video Storage:** Video frames are processed instantly in your device's RAM and are discarded immediately after analysis. They are never saved to disk or uploaded to the internet unless you explicitly choose to generate and save a "Share Video" to your personal photo library.

## 2. HealthKit Integration
*   **Usage:** If you grant permission, The App reads and writes workout data to Apple Health (HealthKit) to sync your active energy (calories) and workout duration.
*   **Protection:** This data remains on your device and within the Apple Health ecosystem. We do not sell or share your health data with third parties.

## 3. Game Center
*   **Usage:** We use Apple's Game Center for leaderboards.
*   **Public Data:** If you choose to participate, your total pushup count and score will be visible to other players on the Game Center leaderboards, associated with your Game Center nickname.

## 4. Data Retention
*   All workout history is stored locally on your device using SwiftData. If you delete the app, this data is permanently removed (unless backed up via your personal iCloud Device Backup).
